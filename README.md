## General info
This repository contains some projects that I had the opportunity to work on during my MSc in Data Analytics at University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK).

Projects:
1. Bristol Price Regression: individual project.
2. DeepLearning: part of a bigger group project, on which I worked in collaboration with 2 colleagues, on 2 datasets (IMDB and fashion MNIST), applying Deep Learning techniques for supervised learning (sentiment analysis and image classification). 

## Technologies
Python 3.7.1 through Anaconda Navigator 4.6.3 (Spyder and Jupyter Notebook)

## Status
Project is: _finished_
